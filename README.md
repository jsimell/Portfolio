# A single page portfolio website with vanilla JavaScript
This project is my first complete web development project. 

I decided to do this project because I wanted to get a good grasp of vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS, before delving deeper into more advanced frameworks. 

Previously I have learned the basics of these techniques, but I have never actually created a complete website from scratch. Thus, this project is a good learning experience for me.
