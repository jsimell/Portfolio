# A single page CV web application with vanilla JavaScript
This project is my first complete web development project. 

I decided to do this project because I wanted to get a good grasp of vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS, before delving deeper into more advanced frameworks. 

Before starting this project, my web development experience consisted of a single course, where the techniques that were used were not vanilla. Thus, this project is a good learning experience for me.
