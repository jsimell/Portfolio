# A single page portfolio with vanilla technologies

This repository contains a simple portfolio website implemented with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My main aim with this project was to learn front-end development with the basic web technologies, before delving deeper into more advanced development frameworks. Furthermore, I wanted to do this project to learn in practice how a simple website can be constructed from scratch. 

The topic I learned the most about during this project was probably CSS. For example, I learned how to use the flexbox layout model and formed a basic understanding of the grid layout as well. Additionally, I learned what must be done to achieve a responsive website design.

Furthermore, I improved my HTML skills, learned about creating dynamic functionality into a website with JS scripts, and understood the basics of choosing good website colors and their ratio.
