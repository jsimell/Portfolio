# A single page portfolio with vanilla technologies
This repository contains a simple portfolio website implemented with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My main aim with this project was to learn front-end development with the basic web technologies, before delving deeper into more advanced development framworks.

I have known for a long time that web development is something that I want to learn. Especially front-end development has seemed interesting to me, because I like it when I can concretely see the results of my work. Thus, I wanted to do this project to learn in practice what it is like to construct a simple website from scratch.

# What I learned during this project
The topic I learned the most about during this project was probably CSS. For example, I learned how to use the flexbox layout model and formed a basic understanding of the grid layout as well. Additionally, I learned what must be done to achieve a responsive website design.

Furthermore, I improved my HTML skills, learned about creating dynamic functionality into a website with JS scripts, and understood the basics of choosing good website colors and their ratio.
