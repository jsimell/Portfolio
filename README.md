**EDIT (Jan 2025):** As I am now looking at the website a year later, I don't feel completely satisfied with some aspects of it. For example, the aesthetics of the landing page could be improved by changing e.g. its background and the layout of the elements. Additionally, another issue is that the visibility of the header, the footer, and the cards may be low for people using a lower screen brightness.

# A single page portfolio with vanilla technologies

This repository contains a simple portfolio website implemented with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My aim with this project was to learn front-end development with the basic web technologies, before delving deeper into more advanced development frameworks. Furthermore, I wanted to do this project to learn how a simple website can be constructed from scratch. 

The topic I learned the most about during this project was probably CSS. For example, I learned how to use the flexbox layout model and formed a basic understanding of the grid layout as well. Additionally, I learned what must be done to achieve a responsive website design.

Furthermore, I improved my HTML skills, learned about creating dynamic functionality into a website with JS scripts, and understood the basics of choosing good website colors and their ratio.
