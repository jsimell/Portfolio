I have known for a long time that web development is something that I want to learn. Especially front-end development has seemed interesting to me, because I like it when I can concretely see the results of my work. Thus, I wanted to do this project because I wanted to see in practice what it is like to form a simple website from scratch. 

This project focuses on front-end development with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The reason for choosing vanilla technologies was that my aim is to form a good understanding of the underlying web development technologies before delving deeper into more advanced frameworks.

# What I learned during this project
The topic I learned the most about during this project was CSS. For example, I learned how to use the flexbox layout model and formed a basic understanding of the grid layout as well. Additionally, I learned what must be done to achieve a responsive website design.

Furthermore, I improved my HTML skills, learned about creating dynamic functionality into a website with JS scripts, and understood the basics of choosing website colors and their ratio.
